Availability Estimate
Write a paragraph or two describing the achievable Recovery Time Objective (RTO) and Recovery Point Objective (RPO) for this Multi-AZ, multi-region database in terms of:

Minimum RTO for a single AZ outage
Minimum RTO for a single region outage
Minimum RPO for a single AZ outage
Minimum RPO for a single region outage

1.- Minimum RTO for a single AZ outage

For single AZ outage, database will be automatically failover to the stand by instance.
So, it will the time it will take to instantiate the new instance.

00:00 - Problem happens (0 minutes)
00:10 - DB instance automatically switch to secondary availability zone (max 10 minutes) as DB size is small.

So, an RTO of 10 minutes for this incident would be reasonable.


2.- Minimum RTO for a single region outage

In the event of region outage, the RTO will be the time to promote the read replica.

00:00 - Problem happens (0 minutes)
00:05 - An amount of time passes before an alert triggers (5 minutes)
00:06 - Alert triggers on-all staff (1 minute)
00:16 - On-call staff may need to get out of bed, get to computer, log in, log onto VPN (10 minutes)
00:21 - On-call staff starts diagnosing issue (5 minutes)
00:30 - Root cause is discovered (9 minutes)
00:35 - Remediation started - promote read replica (5 minutes)
00:45 - Remediation completed (10 minutes)

So, an RTO of 45 minutes for this incident would be reasonable.

3.- Minimum RPO for a single AZ outage

RPO for recovery with an RDS Single-AZ instance failure is typically 5 minutes (the interval required for copying transaction logs to Amazon S3)

4.- Minimum RPO for a single region outage

Amazon RDS for MySQL uses asynchronous replication, however the replication lag is minimum for a high performance database.
For practical purpose we can consider the replication lag of 10 mins across region. So, the  RPO for region outage is approx 10 mins.
